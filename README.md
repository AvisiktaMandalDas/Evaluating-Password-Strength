Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

# Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and evaluate its effectiveness using online password strength checkers.

# Tools Used
-  PasswordMeter.com
-  Security.org Password Strength Checker
-  NordPass Password Checker

# Password Samples and Evaluation

| Password | Length | Complexity    | PasswordMeter Score | Time to Crack (Security.org) | Feedback 

| `abc123` | 6 | Lowercase, Numbers | 25% | <1 second | Too short, predictable |
| `Avi@1234` | 8 | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbol | 63% | 5 hours | Medium strength, can be improved |
| `AviM@nd@l2025` | 13 | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols | 88% | 3 million years | Very strong password |
| `Qz!rT7#pLx$9Wd2` | 15 | Mixed characters, complex structure | 100% | 1 trillion years | Excellent â€“ meets all criteria |

# Tips Learned for Strong Passwords
- Longer is better: Passwords >12 characters are significantly harder to crack.
- Use all character types: Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words: Common words are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
- No personal info: Don't use names, birthdays, or other personal data.
- Unpredictability is key: Random character placement increases strength.
- Avoid reused passwords: Each account should have a unique password.

# Common Password Attacks
  Brute Force- Tries every possible combination until it finds the correct one. 
  Dictionary- Uses a precompiled list of common words/passwords to guess quickly. 
  Credential Stuffing- Uses previously leaked passwords on multiple sites hoping for reuse. 
  Phishing- Tricks users into entering their password on fake websites. 

# Summary: Password Complexity vs. Security
- Passwords with fewer than 8 characters, no symbols or randomness, are highly vulnerable.
- Adding complexity exponentially increases the time and resources needed to crack them.
- Strong password practices can defend against brute force, dictionary, and credential stuffing attacks.

# Outcome
- Understood how password strength is evaluated.
- Learned to create and test strong passwords.
- Gained awareness of password-related attacks and how to defend against them.
